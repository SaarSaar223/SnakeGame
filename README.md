# SnakeGame
/*
I created a snake game in java. Although I had help online to create the game mechanic, I have added many more mechanics and graphics to the game to make it look nice. I added images for the snakes and fixed many of the bugs that were associated with the game, such as the apple forming inside the snake's body, and collisions not working.

I learned a lot of new features of the java language through this code such as java.swing, JPanel, JFrame, Action Listener and KeyListener.
